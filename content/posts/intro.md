# Welcome!

Hi there! I'm Valor, and this is my new technical blog. I've been working in the
tech industry for about five years now, and I've recently transitioned into a
Solution Architect role after serving as a Technical Lead.

In this blog, I'll be sharing my journey, the lessons I've learned, and my
experiences with various technologies, especially Deno and Fresh.

## What to expect

I have several topics planned for future posts:

- How I got to be a technical lead after just five years of work experience
- The most important things I learned during my work as technical lead
- My new Role Of Solution Architect is completely different than I expected
- How we combine Scrum with just two weeks of guarantees and quarterly planning
- Things I had to learn the hard way while coding
